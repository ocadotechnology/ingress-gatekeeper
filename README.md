# ingress-gatekeeper

Monitors instances running in gcp cloud accounts and manages istio whitelist handler objects in Kubernetes, merging optional existing whitelists and GCP cloud instance ips.

## Usage

Environment variables to pass:

`GCP_PROJECT_IDS`

Space separated list of Google cloud project ids to scan for IPs. (Optional)

`SOURCE_HANDLER_NAMES`

Space separated list of istio handler objects in the same namespace to be merged or used as a base list of static ips. (Optional)

`DEST_HANDLER_NAME`

Output istio handler object to be created/managed. This can then be used in your istio rule.

```
SOURCE_HANDLER_NAMES="headoffice-ips remoteoffice-ips"
GCP_PROJECT_IDS="test-project prod-project"
DEST_HANDLER_NAME="test-ingress"
```

### Credentials

For listing GCP instances, a secret needs to be created in the same namespace, containing the key `auth.json`, which value is the base64 encoded json formatted private key from a Google account with enough permissions to list instances. This secret should be mounted at the path `/creds` in the container.

## Testing

use [basht](https://github.com/progrium/basht)

## Older versions

Note that ingress-gatekeeper version 1.x handled nginx ingress whitelisting

Versions below 2.2 used listcheckers instead of handlers.
