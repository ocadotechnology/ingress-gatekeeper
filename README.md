# ingress-gatekeeper

Monitors instances running in cloud accounts and whitelists them on Kubernetes nginx ingress objects

## Usage

Environment variables to pass:

`GCP_PROJECT_IDS`

Space separated list of Google cloud project ids to scan for IPs.

`INGRESS_NAMES`

Space separated list of ingress names in the same namespace to be managed.

`STATIC_IP_RANGES`

Space separated list of IP CIDR ranges to white list (optional).

```
STATIC_IP_RANGES="192.168.1.0/24 192.168.5.0/24"
GCP_PROJECT_IDS="test-project prod-project"
INGRESS_NAMES="test-ingress"
```

### Credentials

A secret named test-ingress needs to be created in the same namespace, containing the key `auth.json`, which value is the base64 encoded json formatted private key from a Google account with enough permissions to list instances. This secret should be mounted at the path `/creds` in the container.
